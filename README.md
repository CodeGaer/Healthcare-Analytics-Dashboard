# Healthcare-Analytics-Dashboard
End-to-end healthcare analytics project built using **SQL, Python, and Power BI** to analyze clinical, demographic, disease, and patient visit patterns across 10,000 patients.

## 📊 Project Overview
This project explores population health insights and hospital utilization trends through an interactive Power BI dashboard.

It integrates:

* SQL data modeling & feature engineering
* Python data generation & preprocessing
* Power BI visualization & storytelling

The dashboard enables analysis of:

* Patient demographics
* BMI & health segmentation
* Disease distribution
* Clinical risk factors
* Patient visit trends over time

## 🧰 Tech Stack

* **SQL (MySQL)** → database schema & feature engineering
* **Python (Pandas, NumPy)** → dataset creation & preparation
* **Power BI** → dashboard & visualization

## 🗄️ Dataset Description

The dataset contains patient-level healthcare records:

* Age, gender, city
* BMI & BMI category
* Blood pressure
* Cholesterol level
* Blood sugar level
* Disease type
* Appointment date
* Health risk classification

## ⚙️ Feature Engineering (SQL)

Derived analytical fields:

* `age_group`
* `health_risk`
* `bp_category`
* `disease_category`

## 📈 Dashboard Pages
